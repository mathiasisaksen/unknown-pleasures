Animation of Unknown Pleasures album art in R, using ggplot2. The result can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/ho7fdg/variations_on_unknown_pleasures/).
main.R contains all of the necessary R code, while video.py is a Python program that creates an mp4 video from the frames.
